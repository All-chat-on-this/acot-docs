# What is ACOT

ACOT (All Chat On This) is a language model caller with powerful compatibility. By configuring API formats specified by major model platforms, ACOT can automatically convert request and response data generated during API interactions into a unified format of interaction data type, achieving cross-platform API adaptation. In theory, as long as a large language model platform has an open API interface, ACOT can connect with it and provide services.

## Application Scenarios

### Wide Compatibility
- Supports integration with multiple third-party large model providers (such as Silicon Flow, Galaxy Recording Bureau, etc.), allowing users to experience various models rather than being limited to the few choices offered by official websites.

### Global Unrestricted Access
- With the help of third-party VPN relay servers, ACOT can call various advanced models from both domestic and international sources without restrictions.

### Unified Session Management
- ACOT provides a unique unified data relay format that supports seamlessly switching between multiple models in the same conversation. For example, you can first chat with the DeepSeek model and then switch to the Claude model while maintaining the complete conversation context for a coherent interaction experience.
